## 📝 Rules of the Game

1. The game generates a random number between **1 and 99**.
2. You have **7 attempts** to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
   - 🔼 **"Too High!"** if your guess is greater than the number.
   - 🔽 **"Too Low!"** if your guess is less than the number.
   - ✅ **"Congratulations!"** if you guess correctly.
4. Enter only valid numbers between **1 and 99**. Invalid inputs won't count as attempts.
5. If you fail to guess correctly in the first **3 attempts**, you'll get a hint (e.g., "The number is even").
6. If you guess the number correctly within **7 attempts**, you win! 🎉
7. If you fail to guess within **7 attempts**, the correct number is revealed, and the game ends.
8. After the game ends, you can choose to play again. 🚀
